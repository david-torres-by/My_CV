    <h1>David Torres</h1>
    <p><em>Associate Technical Consultant at Blue Yonder and Self-Taught Programmer.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>I studied Industrial Engineering at ITESM (Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education).
        in Mexico. During my career I've had the opportunity to develop a project in 6 different countries of Asia, and
        I had a 100% scholarship during my career. I consider myself a builder who likes to create scripts that 
        can ease people's life. In my spare time I like to watch anime and do exercise or read some books.
